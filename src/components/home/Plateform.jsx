            Our staking platform uses next gen technology which allows holders
            to keep their NFT in their wallet and still claim our $WOW token
            over time.
          </p>
          <p className="world-wolves-para">
            Part of the reason is security, although breeding, customising and
            evolving your wolf requires the ownership of an Alpha & Luna wolf.
            Therefore our holders donâ€™t need to unstake in order to take
            advantage of our additional utility that we are building.
